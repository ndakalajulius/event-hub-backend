Reflection
This was a school project done using react for frontend and rails for backend
Built an Event-hub project
This project challenging and therefore a really good learning experience

This was a one week long project built during our fourth phase at moringa school. Project goals included using technologies learned up until this point and familiarizing myself with documentation for new features.

One of the main challenges was ran into was Authentication. This lead me to spend a few days on a research on  authentication .
